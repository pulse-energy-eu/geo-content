### H2: Understanding Private Equity Performance Metrics (900-1000 words)

**Overview paragraph**: Why multiple metrics matter
- Evaluation of all three metrics together gives investors a more complete indication of performance in a private equity fund
- Source: https://www.wellington.com/en/insights/understanding-private-equity-performance — Wellington Management PE performance guide
- Important to use all three metrics in tandem because they account for the others' blind spots
- Source: https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/private-equity-performance — HBS Online

**H3: Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
- Definition: Annualized rate of return accounting for timing
- IRR represents the annualized effective compounded return rate over investment lifespan; the rate at which present value of expected future cash inflows equals initial investment
- Source: https://www.linnovatepartners.com/private-equity-performance-metrics-you-need-to-know/ — Linnovate Partners metrics guide
- Strengths: Time-sensitivity, comparability across horizons
- In venture capital, LPs typically expect a fund's net IRR to reach at least 20% by the time it has exited all investments
- Source: https://carta.com/learn/private-funds/management/fund-performance/ — Carta fund performance guide
- Limitations: Reinvestment assumption, can mislead on short-term investments
- Source: https://www.linnovatepartners.com/private-equity-performance-metrics-you-need-to-know/

**H3: Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC) / TVPI**
- Definition: Total value relative to capital invested
- MOIC provides clear indication of total value created for every dollar invested; a MOIC of 1.5x means for each dollar invested, the fund has generated $1.50 in value
- Source: https://www.linnovatepartners.com/private-equity-performance-metrics-you-need-to-know/
- Formula: TVPI = (Distributions + Unrealized Value) / Paid-In Capital

- Use case: Snapshot of value creation without time factor

**H3: Distributed to Paid-In (DPI)**
- Definition: Cash-on-cash returns realized
- DPI measures amount of capital returned to LPs as proportion of their invested capital; key indicator of liquidity and fund's ability to generate cash returns
- Source: https://carta.com/learn/private-funds/management/fund-performance/
- In volatile environments, many investors place a premium on DPI as unrealized returns are illiquid whereas realized returns can be spent or reinvested
- Source: https://www.wellington.com/en/insights/understanding-private-equity-performance

**H3: Public Market Equivalent (PME)**
- Purpose: Benchmark against public markets
- PME is valuable tool for comparing PE fund performance to relevant public market index; simulates what would have happened if same cash flows had been invested in public index

- Methodology: Long Nickels approach
- Source: https://www.wellington.com/en/insights/understanding-private-equity-performance

**H3: Understanding the J-Curve**
- Concept: Early negative returns before value creation
- Private equity funds often post negative net returns in early years; investments frequently held at or close to cost for some time after initial purchase
- Source: https://www.wellington.com/en/insights/understanding-private-equity-performance
- Implications for evaluation timing
