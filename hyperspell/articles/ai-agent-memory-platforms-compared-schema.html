      "name": "Which AI agent memory platform is best for production agents that need user data access?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "For agents that connect to user workspace data (email, Slack, CRM, calendar, documents), Hyperspell provides the broadest integration coverage with 40+ pre-built connectors and managed OAuth. Other platforms focus on conversation memory or require teams to build integration and authentication layers themselves, which typically takes 3-6 months."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I start with one platform and switch later?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Switching is possible but not trivial. Each platform stores memories in different formats and structures. The migration cost depends on how tightly coupled your agent logic is to the memory API. Starting with a platform whose architecture matches your long-term needs is more efficient than planning to migrate later."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do I need a dedicated memory platform, or can I build my own?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You can build your own, but the engineering cost is significant. OAuth flows for dozens of data sources, API pagination, rate limiting, data normalization, embedding pipelines, and retrieval tuning typically take 3-6 months. Dedicated platforms make sense when memory infrastructure is not your core product and you want to ship agent capabilities faster."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do these platforms handle data privacy?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Approaches vary. Mem0 and Letta offer self-hosting for complete data control. Zep provides BYOK and VPC deployment on enterprise plans. Hyperspell's live search mode queries source APIs in real time without storing user data, offering a privacy-first retrieval option alongside SOC 2 and GDPR compliance. Supermemory offers enterprise self-hosting. Evaluate each platform's certifications against your compliance requirements."
