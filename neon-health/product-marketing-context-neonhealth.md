## Personas

| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| VP Patient Services (Pharma) | Patient outcomes, program costs, time-to-therapy metrics | Manual processes don't scale; can't hire fast enough | Get patients treatments 2x faster at 80% lower cost |
| Director of Pharmacy Ops | Efficiency, accuracy, staff utilization | High-volume, low-margin work; staff burnout | Automate routine workflows; staff handles exceptions only |
| Revenue Cycle Director | Denial rates, clean claims, collection speed | Prior auth delays cause denials and revenue leakage | Accelerate authorizations, reduce denials |

## Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:** The administrative workflows required to get patients access to specialty medications—benefit verification, prior authorization, financial assistance enrollment—are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. This delays therapy initiation and costs the healthcare system billions annually.

**Why alternatives fall short:**
- EDI 270/271 transactions return coverage status but miss therapy-specific rules, step therapy sequences, and PA requirements
- Traditional portal automation is brittle and breaks when payer portals change
- Offshore BPO adds headcount but doesn't fundamentally solve the problem
- Point solutions only address one piece (e.g., just prior auth) rather than the full patient journey

**What it costs them:**
- Average practice spends 12.64 minutes per manual eligibility check
- $118 to reprocess a denied claim
- Full automation of eligibility/BV alone could save $13.9B annually across U.S. healthcare
- Specialty medications: 2-3% of prescription volume but ~55% of total U.S. drug spending

**Emotional tension:** Fear of patients abandoning therapy due to delays. Frustration with hiring more staff to do repetitive work. Anxiety about scaling programs for new drug launches.

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct competitors:**
- Clearinghouse/RCM platforms (Waystar, Availity, Change Healthcare) — fall short because they focus on transactional EDI, not specialty-specific workflows
- Patient hub/services vendors (Lash Group, AssistRx, ConnectiveRx) — fall short because they're still labor-intensive with technology bolted on
- Prior auth automation (Infinx, Cohere Health, Rhyme) — fall short because they only solve one piece of the puzzle

**Secondary competitors:**
- Offshore BPO/staffing — falls short because it adds headcount without automation; doesn't scale efficiently
- In-house teams — fall short because they can't hire fast enough and burn out staff

**Indirect competitors:**
- Status quo (manual processes) — falls short because of high cost, slow speed, poor patient experience

---

## Differentiation

**Key differentiators:**
- **AI workers, not just automation tools**: Neon's AI workforce operates like trained staff, engaging dynamically with payers, portals, and patients
- **Modular, bespoke solutions**: No off-the-shelf product; components (voice, portal automation, rules engines) combined to fit exact workflows
- **Full workflow coverage**: End-to-end from benefit verification through adherence—not just point solutions
- **Consultative implementation**: Work with teams to understand their specific systems, data, and processes

**How we do it differently:** Neon understands healthcare operations are complex. They work consultatively to understand workflows, systems, and data, then design AI-powered solutions that align with how teams actually work. No bloat, no unnecessary build.

**Why that's better:** Teams can focus solely on complex exceptions while automation handles routine work efficiently and accurately.

**Why customers choose us:** "Get patients treatments twice as fast and 80% cheaper."

## Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "AI can't handle the complexity of healthcare workflows" | Our AI workers are trained on healthcare-specific processes and operate with clinical evidence and regulatory compliance at the foundation |
| "We're concerned about data security and HIPAA" | HIPAA compliant, HITRUST and SOC 2 certified—we're committed to being the most secure and reliable tool for our customers |
| "We've tried automation before and it broke" | Unlike brittle portal automation, our AI adapts to changes. Plus we design bespoke solutions fitted to your exact workflows—not off-the-shelf products |

**Anti-persona:** Organizations looking for a plug-and-play, self-service tool with no implementation support. Teams not ready to change their workflows. Simple, low-volume practices without specialty medication complexity.

## Switching Dynamics

**Push (frustrations with current state):**
- Staff overwhelmed by repetitive administrative tasks
- Can't hire fast enough to support new drug launches
- Patients abandoning therapy due to access delays
- High cost-per-patient in hub/support programs

**Pull (attractions to Neon):**
- Promise of 2x faster therapy initiation
- 80% cost reduction
- AI that actually handles the work, not just surfaces information
- Consultative approach that respects workflow complexity

**Habit (what keeps them stuck):**
- Existing vendor relationships and contracts
- Sunk cost in current systems
- Fear of disruption during implementation
- "We've always done it this way"

**Anxiety (worries about switching):**
- Will the AI really work in our complex environment?
- Data security concerns
- Implementation disruption
- What happens when AI fails—who handles exceptions?
